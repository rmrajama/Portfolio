\f0\fs24 \cf0 Welcome to the Bass Line Detection Toolbox for MATLAB. Read this document to get started!\
\
Quick Start:\
1) run "installBLD.m" to add the necessary paths to your MATLAB path\
2) run "main_demo.m" for a few examples (two audio clips are supplied with the toolbox for demo purposes: one stem and one full mix)\
3) run "uninstallBLD.m" when you want to remove the toolbox from your MATLAB path\
\
Comments:\
- When processing your own audio files, you should provide the evaluation functions (if you want to use them that is) with a ground-truth MIDI file, which contains the correct notes and is perfectly aligned with the analysed audio.\
\
Credits:\
This toolbox uses the "MIDI_toolbox" by Ken Schutte, the "matrix2latex" function by M. Koehler and the "multiWaitbar" function by Ben Tordoff.\

The authors - Matts H\'f6glund and Robin Rajam\'e4ki\
